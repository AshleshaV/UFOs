UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview 
The purpose of this task was to create a table with UFO sightings data stored as a JavaScript array. We created a web page with the ability to filter sightings by a variety of different 
variables including, date, city, shape of sighting and other options using html, javascript, vs code and bootstrap.

## Results:
### Welcome to UFO Sightings! 
### How the filters appear when first landing on the page:

## Summary
### Drawback:
### More clear information is possible by adding correct lower-case spellings to filter for search and cannot include spaces at the end.
The placeholders are not clear.

### Recommandations
The next addition to the filters should be to add a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases.
A drop down menu for some of the categories might be better.
